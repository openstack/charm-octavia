  Octavia is an open source, operator-scale load balancing solution designed to
  work with OpenStack.

  Octavia was borne out of the Neutron LBaaS project.  Octavia has become the
  reference implementation for Neutron LBaaS version 2.

  Octavia accomplishes its delivery of load balancing services by managing a
  fleet of virtual machines, containers, or bare metal servers collectively
  known as amphorae which it spins up on demand. This on-demand, horizontal
  scaling feature differentiates Octavia from other load balancing solutions,
  thereby making Octavia truly suited "for the cloud."

  OpenStack Rocky or later is required.
